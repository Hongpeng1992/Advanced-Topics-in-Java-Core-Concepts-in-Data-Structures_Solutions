Write a function that, given an integer n, converts n to binary and stores each bit in one node
of a linked list with the least significant bit at the head of the list and the most significant bit
at the tail. For example, given 13, the bits are stored in the order 1 0 1 1, from head to tail.
Return a pointer to the head of the list.
