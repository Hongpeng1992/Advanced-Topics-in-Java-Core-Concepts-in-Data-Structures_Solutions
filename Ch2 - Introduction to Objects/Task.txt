Consider the problem of working with fractions, where a fraction is represented by two
integer values - one for the numerator and the other for the denominator. For example, 5/9 is
represented by the two numbers 5 and 9. Write a class to manipulate fractions. For example,
write methods to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions. Also, write a method to reduce
a fraction to its lowest terms; you will need to find the HCF of two integers.
